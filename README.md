# PyBrain-NN-for-regression
A PyBrain neural network for regression

This program is a simple multilayered perception written with PyBrain for regression. I used the network to predict basketball spreads from data I collected from [here](https://github.com/KendallWeihe/BB-HTML-Data-Collection). The network had 12,000 games as inputs and converged to 100% accuracy. The program takes input stats from CSV files.

The program is fully tested and functional.
